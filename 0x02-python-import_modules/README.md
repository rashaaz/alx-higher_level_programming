## Resources

Before starting this project, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html)
- [Command line arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/stdlib.html#command-line-arguments)
- [Pycodestyle â€“ Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
- Man or Help: `python3`

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to:

### General
- Understand why Python programming is awesome.
- Import functions from another file.
- Use imported functions.
- Create a module.
- Use the built-in function `dir()`.
- Prevent code in your script from being executed when imported.
- Use command line arguments with your Python programs.

## Copyright and Plagiarism

- You are expected to come up with solutions for the project tasks yourself.
- Copying and pasting someone else's work is not allowed.
- Publishing any content of this project is prohibited.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### General

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should follow the Pycodestyle style guide (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

## Tasks

### 0. Import a simple function from a simple file

- Write a program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of the addition `1 + 2 = 3`.
- You have to use the `print` function with string formatting to display integers.
- You have to assign the value 1 to a variable called `a` and the value 2 to a variable called `b`, using two different lines: `a = 1` and `b = 2`.
- Your program should print: `<a value> + <b value> = <add(a, b) value>` followed by a new line.
- You can only use the word `add_0` once in your code.
- You are not allowed to use `*` for importing or `__import__`.
- Your code should not be executed when imported.
