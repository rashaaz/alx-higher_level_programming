# 0x09. Python - Everything is Object

## Description
This project explores the concept that everything in Python is an object and delves deeper into how Python works with different types of objects. The project includes tasks that require understanding Python's specificity, such as the difference between immutable and mutable objects, aliasing, and the behavior of variables in various scenarios.

## Background Context
Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, letâ€™s pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

BTW, have you ever modified a variable without knowing it or wanting to? I mean:

```python
>>> a = 1
>>> b = a
>>> a = 2
>>> b
1
>>>

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

 General
Why Python programming is awesome
What is an object
What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
What is a reference
What is an assignment
What is an alias
How to know if two variables are identical
How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
What is mutable and immutable
What are the built-in mutable types
What are the built-in immutable types
How does Python pass variables to functions
