# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance

## Overview
This repository contains Python scripts and a class hierarchy focusing on the concept of inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP). The project covers various tasks related to inheritance, superclass, subclass, method overriding, and class design.

## Project Details

## Learning Objectives
After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using Google:

### General
- The awesomeness of Python programming.
- What a superclass, base class, or parent class is.
- What a subclass is.
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance.
- Conditions for adding new attributes to an instance.
- How to inherit a class from another.
- Defining a class with multiple base classes.
- The default class every class inherits from.
- Method or attribute overriding in a base class.
- Attributes or methods available by heritage to subclasses.
- The purpose of inheritance.
- Usage of `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type`, and `super` built-in functions.

## Requirements
### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line.
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`.

### Python Test Cases
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files should be inside a folder named `tests`.
- Test files should have a text file extension (e.g., `.txt`).
- Execute tests using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules, classes, and functions should have documentation.

### Documentation
- Do not use the words `import` or `from` inside your comments.
- Documentation should be meaningful sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method.

### Copyright - Plagiarism
- No content from this project should be published.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Tasks
### 0. Lookup
Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:

```python
def lookup(obj):
    """
    Returns a list object
    """
