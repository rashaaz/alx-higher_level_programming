# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

## Project Description

This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. The main goal is to develop functions while keeping testing at the forefront. The key concepts include writing documentation and tests before implementing the actual code. The project aims to enhance your understanding of Python programming, the importance of tests, and how to find and handle edge cases.

- **Project End:** Nov 29, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Checker Release:** Nov 29, 2023, 6:00 AM
- **Auto Review:** Will be launched at the deadline

## Concepts

The primary concept for this project is "Never forget a test." The background context emphasizes writing documentation and tests before coding, not trusting the user, and considering all possible edge cases. The provided resources include information on doctest, unit tests in Python, and interactive/non-interactive tests.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Explain why Python programming is awesome.
- Define what an interactive test is.
- Understand the importance of tests.
- Write docstrings to create tests.
- Write documentation for each module and function.
- Identify basic option flags to create tests.
- Find edge cases in your code.

## Copyright - Plagiarism

- Do not copy and paste someone else's work.
- Do not publish any content of this project.
- Plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements

### Python Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- All files end with a new line
- The first line of all files is `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Code should use `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*)
- All files must be executable
- File length will be tested using `wc`

### Python Test Cases

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All test files end with a new line
- Test files are inside a folder named `tests`
- Test files are text files with the extension `.txt`
- Tests are executed using the command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All modules have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All functions have documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'`)
- Documentation is a real sentence explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method
