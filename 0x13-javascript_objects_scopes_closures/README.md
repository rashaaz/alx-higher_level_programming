# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

## Description

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to JavaScript objects,
scopes, and closures. The tasks cover various concepts including creating objects, inheritance, closures, and more.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand the fundamentals of JavaScript programming
- Create objects in JavaScript
- Grasp the concept of `this` and `self`
- Comprehend the significance of variable types and scopes
- Define closures and their applications
- Utilize prototypes for object inheritance
- Inherit objects from others

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js (version 14.x).
- Code must be semistandard compliant and follow AirBnB style.
- Ensure files are executable.
- Do not use `var`.
- Install Node.js 14 and `semistandard` using the provided commands.
- Use allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- The first line of all files must be `#!/usr/bin/node`.
- All files must end with a new line.

## Tasks

### 0. Rectangle #0

Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.

### 1. Rectangle #1

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with specified width and height.

### 2. Rectangle #2

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle, handling cases where width or height is not a positive integer.

### 3. Rectangle #3

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle, implementing an instance method `print()` to print the rectangle using the character 'X'.

### 4. Rectangle #4

Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle, adding instance methods `rotate()` and `double()`.

### 5. Square #0

Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle`.

### 6. Square #1

Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Square`, adding an instance method `charPrint(c)`.

### 7. Occurrences

Write a function `nbOccurences()` that returns the number of occurrences in a list.

### 8. Esrever

Write a function `esrever()` that returns the reversed version of a list without using the built-in method `reverse`.

### 9. Log me

Write a function `logMe()` that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.

### 10. Number conversion

Write a function `converter()` that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.
