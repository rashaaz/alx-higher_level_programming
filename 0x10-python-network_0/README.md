# 0x10. Python - Network #0

## Overview

This repository contains Bash and Python scripts developed as part of the "0x10. Python - Network #0" project at ALX High-Level Programming. These scripts are designed to interact with web servers using various HTTP methods and demonstrate understanding of network fundamentals.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, learners will achieve the following learning objectives:

- Understanding of HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
- Familiarity with HTTP requests and responses
- Mastery of using cURL for making HTTP requests
- Knowledge of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE
- Ability to work with HTTP headers and parameters
- Implementation of network scripts in Bash and Python

## Requirements

- Scripts must be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Bash scripts must be exactly 3 lines long, with proper comments
- Python scripts must adhere to PEP8 style guidelines
- Documentation is required for all modules, classes, and functions
- Plagiarism is strictly prohibited

## Project Structure

The project contains the following scripts:

### Bash Scripts

1. **0-body_size.sh**: Retrieves the size of the response body from a given URL.
2. **1-body.sh**: Displays the body of the response for a URL with a 200 status code.
3. **2-delete.sh**: Sends a DELETE request to the provided URL and displays the response body.
4. **3-methods.sh**: Displays all HTTP methods accepted by the server for a given URL.
5. **4-header.sh**: Sends a GET request to a URL with a custom header and displays the response body.
6. **5-post_params.sh**: Sends a POST request to a URL with specified parameters and displays the response body.

### Python Scripts

1. **6-peak.py**: Contains a function to find a peak in an unsorted list of integers.
2. **6-peak.txt**: Describes the complexity of the peak-finding algorithm.

## Usage

To use these scripts, execute them in a terminal environment following the provided usage instructions.

## Testing

Scripts should be tested using the provided sandbox environment, utilizing the web server running on port 5000.
